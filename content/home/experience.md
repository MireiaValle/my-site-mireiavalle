Developing own research project under collaboration with BC3 and NCEAS. The project entitled FutureSea aims to envision the social-ecological future of seascapes under climate change: Integrating an ecological trait-based approach and social participatory scenario. To do so, I am using  a  functional  trait-based ecosystem approach and I will apply  participatory modelling and scenarios approach in order to provide new insight for adaptiveecosystem management and analyseways to improve policies to help vulnerable societies  that  depend  on  marine  ecosystems to  transit  towards  more  resilient  social-ecological systems recommendations."""
