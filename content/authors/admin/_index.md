She is at the first year of her research stage at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis-NCEAS working under the supervision of Dr. Benjamin S. Halpern and Dr. Unai Pascual from the BC3.

With her research, she wants to envision the social-ecological future of seascapes under climate change to help us address some of the problems that marine ecosystems are facing around the world. To do so, she will focus on marine fish functional and cultural traits
