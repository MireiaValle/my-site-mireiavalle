## Goals: 

1) Provide consensus view of the key features of climate-resilient fisheries and examples of application of these features in fishery management systems. 

2) Develop a decision support tool to help managers identify resilience capacity and needs, and to provide guidance on approaches to enhance resilience. 

3) Work with leaders of fishery management organizations to tailor results and products for global, national, and regional application in a variety of fisheries.
