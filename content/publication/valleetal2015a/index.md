abstract: Seagrass meadows are essential and ecologically important habitats in marine ecosystems providing physical, biological, economic and social benefits. Concern over their decreasing trends has triggered the development of many restoration programs worldwide. This research aims to define adequate strategies to restore Zostera noltii meadows through the application of field based experiments. To this end, we undertook transplant experiments. Results showed a greater growth of Z. noltii within sandy sediments in comparison to muddy sediments. Nevertheless, long term survival of transplants was observed for muddy environments sheltered from high water current. Applied habitat suitability model rightfully predicted the success of the transplant, suggesting such models as appropriate management-decision tools for selecting transplant sites. Although donor bed recovery was assessed using different strategies, from a similar state as starting point, seagrass recovered quicker in sandy sediment. In the light of our results several considerations in order to increase the chance of a successful restoration are stated to provide a sound basis to plan and implement further restoration projects of Z. noltii.
