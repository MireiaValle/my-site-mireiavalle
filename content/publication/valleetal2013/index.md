abstract: Intertidal seagrasses show high variability in their extent and location, with local extinctions and colonizations being inherent in their population dynamics. Suitable habitats are identified usually using Species Distribution Models, based upon the overall distribution of the species; thus, accounting solely for spatial variability. To include temporal effects caused by large interannual variability, we constructed SDMs for different combinations and fusions of yearly distribution data. The methodology presented offers a promising tool for selecting realistic conservation areas for those species that show high population dynamics, such as many estuarine and coastal species.
